## Create Your Own

Loot Survivor is dependant on having reliable client providers to maintain uptime of interfaces to display data and interact with the contract. We also want to incentivise experimenting with designs that will further attract players to Loot Survivor and grow the series as a whole.

This is why we have fully open-sourced all code and provided a reward (27% of LORDS fees) that anyone can utilise to to create and earn.

The UI and contracts are all located in this repo: https://github.com/Provable-Games/loot-survivor.git
