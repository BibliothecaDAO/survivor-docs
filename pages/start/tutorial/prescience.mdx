## Prescience

It is crucial to utilise the adventurers special ability of seeing the outcomes ahead of time for a single level. This ability exists as the game entropy is changed on level ups, so outcomes between levels are predictable.

The first column in the table shows the starting xp of the adventurer for a specific encounter, and the last column shows the total xp after it. To read the table correctly the player should map the end xp to the matching starting xp on a following row to asses what encounter will come next. This pattern should be repeated until the next xp results in reaching a higher level, then the entropy will change and result in different future encounters.  

To maximise effectiveness it is important to know that fleeing a beast increases adventurer xp by 1. For example there might be a beneficial strategy to flee a beast even if it is defeatable to get a more favourable future outcome.

Some other more obvious strategies when utilising the information provided in this table are:

- Increasing intelligence if it reaches the required avoid roll for obstacles.
- Increasing wisdom if it reaches the required avoid roll for obstacles.
- Buying/switching armor types to weaken obstacle and beast attacks.
- Buying/switching weapon types to strengthen adventurer attacks.
