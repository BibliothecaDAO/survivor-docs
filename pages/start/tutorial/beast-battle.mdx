## Discovered a Beast!

Discovering beasts will lock you in the battle screen.

### Attack

Think you have what it takes to slay it? You can choose to attack once or fight till the death! The latter will consecutively attack until either you or the beast is defeated.

The "Battle Result" box will show your final HP at the end of a battle. Displaying this makes it fair between humans and bots as this information is predictable!

### Flee

About to get owned? You can attempt to flee with a chance of success or an attack from the beast. Fleeing succesfully will grant 1 xp and set you back to exploring. Similarly to above, fleeing till death will consecutively flee until you succeed or die!

The "Flee Result" box will show your final HP at the end of all flee attempts. Choose wisely.
