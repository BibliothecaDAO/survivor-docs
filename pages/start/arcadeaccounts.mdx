# Arcade Accounts

Arcade accounts allow signature free gameplay by creating a permissioned account that can only perform certain actions. It is created by your primary account and stores the keys in the browser.

NOTE: IF YOU DELETE BROWSER COOKIES YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ARCADE ACCOUNT. YOU CAN WITHDRAW FUNDS TO YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME.

To recover your AA, go to the AA button, select recover account and input the arcade account address. Check you are connected to the primary account that created the AA.
