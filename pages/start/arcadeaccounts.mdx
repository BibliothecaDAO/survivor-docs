# Arcade Accounts

Arcade Accounts are "burner" accounts that can only interact with the permissions.

The permissions given to the arcade account can only do limited actions for security, these include interacting with the game functions and transfers to a "master" account.
The "master" account is the account that create the Arcade Account (AA). It works by storing the keys in the browser.

Arcade Accounts are **free** to create however it will initiate a transfer of 0.001 ETH from your connected wallet to the AA to cover your transaction costs (gas) from normal gameplay.
