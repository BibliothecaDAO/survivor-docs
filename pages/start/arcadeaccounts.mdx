# Arcade Accounts

Arcade Accounts (AA) are "burner" accounts that provide signature free gameplay.

## How does it work?

The Arcade Account or AA, is deployed by the main account and can only perform certain actions.It works by deploying a pre-funded account amount (0.01 ETH & 25 LORDS) from your main account to your AA and stores the keys in the browser. Arcade accounts are less secure than using your main wallet however, you can help keep it secure by changing your keys.

## How can I see my keys?

To get your public and private key, follow the below steps. You can also set new keys to your AA.

- Right-click in the browser and click inspect
- At the header bar (Elements, console etc.), click Application
- On the application tab click Storage -> Local storage (dropdown) then the URL
- Your keys will be shown on the right

## How can I change my keys?

Changing keys helps to keep arcade accounts secure, change your keys at any time in the AA menu. Ensure you are connected to your main account before changing the keys.
