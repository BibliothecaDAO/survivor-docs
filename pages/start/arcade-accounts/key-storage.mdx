# Key Storage

## How can I see my keys?

Arcade Account keys are stored in browser local storage and can be checked at any point.

1. Right click anywhere in the UI and click "Inspect":

3. Within "Application" navigate under "Storage". Click on "Local Storage" -> Select the url. You will then find the accounts under burner with all the sensitive key info:

## How can I change my keys?

Loot Survivor also supports key rotations, meaning if you feel that your private key may have been exposed you can generate a new one.

To create a new key for your Arcade Account there is an option in the Arcade Accounts screen in Loot Survivor, you must be connected to the master account:
