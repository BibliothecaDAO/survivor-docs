# Key Storage

## How can I see my keys?

Arcade Account keys are stored in browser local storage and can be checked at any point.

1. Right click anywhere in the UI and click "Inspect":

<img src="/arcade-accounts/inspect-tab.png" alt="Inspect Tab" />

2. Click the double arrow in the top right and click "Application":

<img src="/arcade-accounts/application-tab.png" alt="Application Tab" style={{ height: "500px", width: "500px" }} />

3. Within "Application" navigate under "Storage". Click on "Local Storage" -> Select the url. You will then find the accounts under burner with all the sensitive key info:

<img src="/arcade-accounts/burners-tab.png" alt="Burners Tab" style={{ height: "500px", width: "500px" }} />

## How can I change my keys?

Loot Survivor also supports key rotations, meaning if you feel that your private key may have been exposed you can generate a new one.

To create a new key for your Arcade Account there is an option in the Arcade Accounts screen in Loot Survivor, you must be connected to the master account:
