# Migrate Account

Loot Survivor has several <Link href="/clients" style={{color: '#32CD32', textDecoration: 'underline'}}>clients</Link>, each having a unique approach to displaying gameplay, whilst still interacting with the original Loot Survivor contract.

We provide a method to transfer your AA between the clients without the need to recover by exporting the Private Keys.

**NOTE**: With usual wallets this would be unsecure, however, Arcade Accounts have strict permissions to limit any misuse of funds other than playing!

## Export Arcade Account Private Key

Exporting the Private Key will copy it to your clipboard. You will then be able to import the key to other applications utilising this component.

## Import Arcade Account

There is a screen within Arcade Accounts to insert your Private Key and integrate your AA.
