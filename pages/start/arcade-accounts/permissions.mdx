# Permissions

The permissions given to the arcade account can only do limited actions for security, these include, interacting with the game functions (attack, flee, explore etc.) and transfers to a "master" account.
The "master" account is the account that created the Arcade Account (AA). AA's are controlled by the player by storing the keys in the browser.

Currently there are a set of permissions that the UI sets on AA creation.

- Key Loot Survivor actions
- Transfers of Eth + Lords to master
