# Combat

There are a variety of factors that affect the outcome of combat between adventurers and beasts. Weapon power calculations apply the following order of operations:

- Base attack calculation
- Elemental adjustments

The following bonuses are then added using power after elemental adjustments:

- Strength bonus *(None for beasts)*
- Critical hit bonus
- Name match bonus

Armor power is calculated as follows:

- Base armor calculation
- Jewelry bonus *(None for beasts)*

Finally, we negate armor power from attack power to get the net damage calculation. 

`Weapon power - Armor power = Damage`

## Base Calculation

The base calculation for the power of adventurer weapons and armor:

`Item Greatness * (6 - Tier)`

The calculations for beast power utilises the same formula, but substitutes Level for Greatness:

`Beast Level * (6 - Beast Tier)`

## Elemental Adjustments

> Weak/Fair/Strong gives 50%/100%/150% damage to certain Armor Type.

| Weapon vs Armor | `Metal`  | `Hide`  | `Cloth`  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `Blade`         | Weak   | Fair   | Strong |
| `Bludgeon`      | Fair   | Strong | Weak   |
| `Magic`         | Strong | Weak   | Fair   |

## Critical hits

Increasing Luck increases your chances of getting critical hits where the chance is `luck / 100`. In the event of a critical hit, the damage increase is randomly rolled between `20-100%`.

## Name match bonus

When beasts are level 19+, they will have name prefixes such as "Whisper Glow". In combat, if any of these 2 name prefixes match any of your item name prefixes (unlocked from greatness 19+) name match bonuses are applied to damage. 

A `20%-100%` bonus is applied from matching a name suffix, such as "Glow", and a `4-7x` bonus from matching a name prefix, such as "Whisper".
