# Damage Boosts

## Base Calculation

Beast base attack damage and armor is:

`Greatness * (6 - Tier)`

If your attack is less than the beast armor then a minimum damage of 4 will be applied.

## Efficacies

> Weak/Fair/Strong gives 50%/100%/150% damage to certain Armor Type.

| Weapon vs Armor | `Metal`  | `Hide`  | `Cloth`  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `Blade`         | Weak   | Fair   | Strong |
| `Bludgeon`      | Fair   | Strong | Weak   |
| `Magic`         | Strong | Weak   | Fair   |

## Critical hits

Luck derives your chances of getting critical hits, providing a 20-100% damage bonus. Criticial hit chance is calculated from `luck / 100`.

## Name match bonus

When beasts are level 19+, they will have name prefixes such as "Whisper Glow". If this name prefix matches any of your item name prefixes (unlocked from greatness 19+) name match bonuses are applied to damage. 

A 20%-100% bonus is applied from matching a name suffix ("Glow"), and a 4-7x bonus from matching a name prefix ("Whisper").
