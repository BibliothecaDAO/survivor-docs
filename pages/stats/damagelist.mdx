# Damage Boosts

## Base Damage Calculation

Beast base attack damage and armor is:

`Greatness * (6 - Tier)`

If your attack is less than the beast armor then a minimum damage of 4 will be applied.

## Efficacies

> Weak/Fair/Strong gives 50%/100%/150% damage to certain Armor Type.

| Weapon vs Armor | Metal  | Hide   | Cloth  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `Blade`         | Weak   | Fair   | Strong |
| `Bludgeon`      | Fair   | Strong | Weak   |
| `Magic`         | Strong | Weak   | Fair   |

## Critical hits

At Greatness 20, you may come across a beast with a name prefix such as "Whisper Glow", if this name prefix matches any of your item prefixes it can achieve critical hits. Critical hits provide a 4-7x damage increase. The maximum critical hit chance provided by Luck is, 100% Critical Hit == 100 Luck.
